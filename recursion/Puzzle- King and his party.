##Approach:

Puzzle says the king have 1000 bottles so we can represent 1000 in binary by 10 bit that is 2^10(1024 >= 100).
We will assign numbers 1 to 10 to all the 10 prisoners also will assign 1 to 1000 to all the win bottles,
and make the set of bottles according to the below algorithm:

##Algorithm:

1) we will represent the numbers in binary fashion.
2) Firstly we will give the 1st prisoner that bottles in which the 1st bit(LSB) is 'ON'(or 1)
3) Repeat the process until all the bottles distributed among all the prisoners.
4) Each prisoner will get approximately 100 bottles to test.
5) Now after 7days all those prisoner dies which had tasted that poisined bottle.

##Lets take the Example:

Considring 10 digit binary.

Bottle 1 => 0000000001
Bottle 2 => 0000000010
.
.
.
.
.
Bottle 999 => 1111100111
Bottle 1000 => 1111101000

Now let bottle no 999th is poisoned: 

prisoners who get bottles accordingly
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1  1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 (binary of 999)
we can clearly see that prisoner number 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1 will die.

##Result:

so we clearly see that the imposter bottle is 999th.

Hence after 7days we will save all the rest 999 bottles are safe to drink
King can enjoy his party.
